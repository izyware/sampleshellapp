A modern web application architecture leveraging IzyWare to deliver your application 'shell' and populate the content using JS. This means you can get pixels on the screen without the network, even if the content eventually comes from the network - a great performance win. In browsers without IzyWare, we gracefully degrade to server-side rendering.
